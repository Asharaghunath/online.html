        Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[c] (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit, meaning great-souled, or venerable), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.[2]
        
        Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple in London and was called to the bar at the age of 22. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. Here, Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against discrimination and excessive land tax.

Jawaharlal Nehru (/ˈneɪru/ NAY-roo or /ˈnɛru/ NERR-oo,[1] Hindi: [dʒəˌʋaːɦəɾˈlaːl ˈneːɦɾuː] ⓘ; 14 November 1889 – 27 May 1964) was an Indian statesman who was a central figure in India during the middle of the 20th century. Nehru was second only to Mahatma Gandhi in leading the Indian nationalist movement in the 1930s and 1940s, and upon independence from Britain in 1947 served as India's first prime minister until his death in 1964. A secular humanist and social democrat,[2] Nehru championed parliamentary democracy, secularism, science and technology, influencing India's arc as a modern nation. In international affairs, he kept India out of the two blocs of the Cold War and was a founder of the Non-Aligned modern nation.

Subhas Chandra Bose[h] (23 January 1897 – 18 August 1945) was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among many Indians, but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy vexed by authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure. The honorific 'Netaji' (Hindustani: "Respected Leader") was first applied to Bose in Germany in early 1942—by the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin. It is now used throughout India.[i]

    Lal Bahadur Shastri (pronounced [lɑːl bəˈɦɑːd̪ʊɾ ˈʃɑːst̪ɾiː] ⓘ; born Lal Bahadur Srivastava; 2 October 1904 – 11 January 1966) was an Indian politician and statesman who served as the 2nd Prime Minister of India from 1964 to 1966. He previously served as Home Minister from 1961 to 1963.
    
    Shastri was born in a Hindu Chitraguptavanshi Kayastha community to Sharad Prasad Srivastava and Ramdulari Devi in Mughalsarai (present-day Uttar Pradesh) on 2 October 1904. He studied in East Central Railway Inter college and Harish Chandra High School, which he left to join the non-cooperation movement. He worked for the betterment of the Harijans at Muzaffarpur and dropped his caste-derived surname of "Srivastava". Shastri's thoughts were influenced by reading about Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi and Annie Besant. Deeply impressed and influenced by Gandhi, he joined the Indian Independence movement in the 1920s. He served as the president of Servants of the People Society (Lok Sevak Mandal), founded by Lala Lajpat Rai and held prominent positions in the Indian National Congress.
